#### Development

After an experimental and developmental stage of two years, Globasa was published on July 26th, 2019 with a complete core grammar and 1,000 root words, ready to be put into practice. Since then, Globasa has undergone further [development](https://www.globasa.net/eng/max/alogi-ji-lilalogi) with the help and collaboration of the auxlang community, but has otherwise remained [relatively stable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Globasa/comments/qskclh/globasas_stability_comparison_of_original_globasa/) and true to its vision. With over 9,000 total dictionary entries, a [beginner's course](https://xwexi.globasa.net/eng/darsu) and plenty of reading material, Globasa is currently in [Phase 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/Globasa/comments/15a8861/fase_6/) of its developmental and growth stage.
