#### The Language of the World Citizen

Globasa is the product of an elaborate thought experiment. It envisions the linguistic outcome of a hypothetical scenario whereby 1,000 people from around the world are randomly selected to permanently inhabit an island. What would the community's language look like within three generations? This is Globasa's guiding vision.

After an experimental and developmental stage of two years, Globasa was published on July 26th, 2019 with a complete core grammar and 1,000 root words, ready to be put into practice. Since then, Globasa has undergone further [development](https://www.globasa.net/eng/max/alogi-ji-lilalogi) with the help and collaboration of the auxlang community, but has otherwise remained [relatively stable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Globasa/comments/qskclh/globasas_stability_comparison_of_original_globasa/) and true to its vision. With over 3,000 root words and over 8,000 total dictionary entries, a [beginner's course](https://xwexi.globasa.net/eng/darsu) and plenty of reading material, Globasa is currently in [Phase 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/Globasa/comments/15a8861/fase_6/) of its developmental and growth stage.

Globasa's design is primarily the work of a linguist, translator and expert in adult language acquisition and teaching. It has been created with the average world citizen in mind to be as easy as possible to learn and to use without sacrificing clarity and degree of expressiveness. Its design, reminiscent of the world's creole languages, is the result of the following [guiding principles](https://www.globasa.net/eng/max/gidane-principi):
