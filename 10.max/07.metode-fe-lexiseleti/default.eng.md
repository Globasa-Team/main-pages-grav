## Methodology for Lexical Development in Globasa

**Preliminary Step**: Before rushing to expand Globasa's dictionary with a new root word, determine if the desired word can potentially be expressed through an already established root word or through a word formation method (affixing or compounding). Based on that determination, decide whether or not to propose a new root word.

**Three-Part Methodology:**

(1) Establishing the etymological source for the word

(2) Determining the semantics of the word

(3) Determining the exact form (lettering) of the word

## Establishing the Etymological Source

### Caveats

The following caveats must be kept in mind during the source selection process. Whenever necessary, an effort should be made to adapt word forms based on the caveats below using the most widely international etymological source. However, if this is not possible, a less widely international source should be used instead.  

-   _Never_ adopt minimal pairs with _v_ and _w_, _s_ and _z_ or word-final position _m_ and _n_.

-   Unless there is absolutely no other option and it has been thoroughly investigated for potential issues with affixed words, _never_ adopt a minimal pair with plus/minus a consonant or vowel at the beginning/end of words.

-   Whenever possible, avoid minimal pairs with _l_ and _r_, _b_ and _p_, _f_ and _p_, _c_ and _j_, _c_ and _x_, _h_ and _r_ or minimal pairs with plus/minus a vowel at the beginning/end of words.

-   Whenever possible, avoid _any_ minimal pair: Whenever there is more than one more or less equal _word-form_ option, choose the form that does not create a minimal pair.

-   Whenever possible, avoid one-syllable words and words longer than three syllables: Whenever there is more than one more or less equal _source_ option, choose the source with two or three syllables, or add an [_a posteriori_](/pimpan-swal/metode-fe-lexiseleti#a_posteriori) vowel to produce a two-syllable word. Also, keep in mind that Globasa favors three-syllable words over two-syllable words.  

-   Whenever possible, avoid words that appear to be affixed: Whenever there is more than one more or less equal _word-form_ option, choose the form that does not appear to be affixed.

### Source Selection Algorithm

-   Check the following languages on online sources such as Google Translate, [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/) and Wikipedia as well as use print dictionaries as support when in doubt: English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Hindi, Telugu, Arabic, Swahili, Persian, Turkish, Indonesian, Filipino. You may also want to try the [Globasa Etymology Helper](https://globasa-etymology-helper.glitch.me/) app. 

    -   Select the source with the most language families represented.
        -   English, French, German, Russian and Spanish are considered one family.  
        -   Indonesian and Filipino are in the same family.
        -   Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Hindi, Telugu, Arabic, Swahili, Persian and Turkish are all in different families.

    -   If there is a tie in number of families represented, the order of priority for source selection is as follows:
        -   Any two or more of the Asian languages: Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese
        -   Arabic, supported by any other language or languages (Persian or Swahili, for example)
        -   Hindi, supported by any other language or languages (Telugu, Indonesian, or any European language, for example)
        -   European languages, supported by any other language or languages (Indonesian, Filipino or Turkish, for example)
        -   Persian and Turkish

    -   If there is no agreement, do a more thorough search with other parts of speech or with synonyms.

    -   If there is still no agreement, choose the most appropriate source based on the following order of priority.
        -   Indonesian _and_ Filipino
        -   Arabic
        -   Swahili
        -   Mandarin
        -   Hindi

    -   Keep in mind that the caveats above always trump the source selection guidelines.

## Determining Semantics of the Word

In this step, a determination should be made as to whether the new root will be a noun/verb word or an adj/adv word. Other considerations should be whether the new root will denote a person or tool, or whether the word denoting a person or tool will be derived out of the new root. 

-	Part of speech is typically determined by which appears to be more useful (i.e., more frequently used in practice).

-	In some cases, the part of speech that seems the most useful isn't well supported by the source languages, in which case, the part of speech is selected based on the greatest support in the source languages.

-	In some cases, the less commonly used part of speech is selected in order to better accommodate derived words. For example, Globasa has **termo** (_heat_) as a noun, rather than something like **_garme_** (_warm_) in order to easily use **termo** in compound scientific words such as _thermodynamics_, as well as to more easily derive words like **termodo** (_heated_), as opposed to **_garmegido_**. 

-	In the case of words that denote people, there are specific guidelines for determining the root word. Some words denoting professions are derived using **-yen** or **-kef** while others are root words. Derived words denoting professions are derived from root words denoting _verb/practice_, _team_ or _establishment_ (but not the _professional's office_). Otherwise, the word denoting a profession is typically a root word: **biskopo** (bishop), etc. 

    -	_verb/practice_ 
        -	**ato** (act) -- **atoyen** (actor)   
        -	**medis** (medicine) -- **medisyen** (physician)  
        -	**injeneri** (engineering) -- **injeneriyen** (engineer)  
        -	**arkitetur** (architecture) -- **arkiteturyen** (architect)   
        -	**jasusi** (espionage) -- **jasusiyen** (spy)  
    
    -	_team_  
        -	**polisi** (police) -- **polisiyen** (police officer)  
        -	**askeri** (army) -- **askeriyen** (soldier)  
        -	**senato** (senate) -- **senatoyen** (senator)  
 
    -	_establisment_  
        -	**banko** (bank) -- **bankoyen** (banker)  
        -	**eskol** (school) -- **eskolkef** (principal)   
        
    -	_professional's office_
        -	**sekretari** (secretary) -- **sekretaridom** (secretary, secretariat)

## Determining Exact Form of the Word

-   Apply the caveats above.

-   Try finding a middle ground when creating a blend between the words in the various languages. However, keep in mind that words sourced from European languages tend to favor spelling (see details below). An effort should be made to keep blends as natural as possible. That is, there should be a difference of only one phoneme from the form of any natural language. A difference of two phonemes is also acceptable if the phonemes are close to those of any natural language. 

-   An effort should be made to avoid noun/verb words beginning with the syllables _le-_, _xa-_, _nun-_, _ger-_, _be-_ and _du-_ so as to avoid confusion with verb particles. 

-   Select consonants and vowels that are the least common in Globasa.
    -   All else being more or less equal, choose _e_ over _a_, _e_ over _i_, _o_ over any other vowel except _u_ (_u_ over _o_).
    -   All else being more or less equal, choose _m_ over _n_, _l_ over _r_, _h_ over _k_, _g_ over _k_, _d_ over _t_, _p_ over _b_.
    -   However, all else being more or less equal, choose _s_ over _z_ and _w_ over _v_. <a id="a_posteriori"></a>

-   Root words in Globasa tend to end in a vowel, preferably an _a posteriori_ vowel found in at least one of the major languages or language families. 

    -   Examples of _a posteriori_ final vowels: Spanish words ending in _-o_ or _-a_, Swahili words ending in _-i_ or _-u_, or Japanese words ending in _-u_.
    -   [Caveats](https://www.reddit.com/r/Globasa/comments/phwnv1/naturalistic_final_vowels_to_add_or_not_to_add/):
        -   Caveat 1: If the word would consist of four of more syllables, the vowel is not added if there is at least one language that has the word ending in a consonant: [**estrutur**](https://menalari.globasa.net/eng/lexi/estrutur), etc. 
            -   However, noun/verbs that end in _-ation/-ate_ in English always add **-a** in Globasa, regardless of word length: [**diskrimina**](https://menalari.globasa.net/eng/lexi/diskrimina), etc. 
            -   In addition, words that end in _-ia/-io_ in Spanish, in _-aire/-oire_ in French and in _-y_ in English typically end in **-i** in Globasa regardless of word length: **ordinari**, **teritori**, **sekretari**, etc.   
        -   Caveat 2: In a few select, very common words, a final vowel is not added in order to keep the word at two syllables: **eskol**, **alim**, **muhim**, etc. This is now a closed caveat, since all sufficiently common words have been added.
        -   Caveat 3: If the etymology of a word includes eight or more languages with the word in question ending in a consonant, the Globasa word does _not_ add a final vowel. For example, see [**tufan**](https://menalari.globasa.net/eng/lexi/tufan) and [**salun**](https://menalari.globasa.net/eng/lexi/salun). Compare with [**safe**](https://menalari.globasa.net/eng/lexi/safe), [**taru**](https://menalari.globasa.net/eng/lexi/taru) and [**jusu**](https://menalari.globasa.net/eng/lexi/jusu). 

    -   An _a priori_ vowel should only be added if the last consonant is one which phonotactic rules do not allow in word-final position (_b, c, d, g, h, j, k, p, t, v, z_) or to create a two-syllable word if the source word consists of one syllable (for example, see [**pole**](https://menalari.globasa.net/eng/lexi/pole), which adds **-e** to avoid minimal pairs with **bol** and **pul**). To select an _a priori_ vowel, use the following guidelines:

        -   Indo-European (Romance, Slavic, Germanic, Hindi, Persian): **-i** for English verbs, otherwise **-e**.
        -   All others (Mandarin, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese; Arabic; Indonesian and Filipino): **-u**.
       
-    The _a posteriori_ or _a priori_ initial vowel **e-** is added to initial consonant clusters not allowed by Globasa phonotactics: **espageti**, **Esrilanka**, **Exkiperi**, etc. 

### Words Sourced from European Languages

-    Words sourced from European languages tend to favor spelling of both consonants and vowels.

-    The consonants ⟨c⟩, ⟨g⟩, and ⟨s⟩, in particular, remain intact if there is at least one European language which pronounces them as /tʃ/, /g/ and /s/ respectively: **centro**, **geo**, **visita**, etc. 

-    This rule of thumb is especially important when it comes to the way vowels are rendered in languages that have borrowed European words via English. For example, the word for _rum_ is rendered as /ram/ in many languages, as an approximation of English /rʌm/. In spite of this /a/ being more prevalent, Globasa retains ⟨u⟩ in the original spelling: **rum**. 

-    Words that end in [_-tion_ or _-(s)sion_](https://www.reddit.com/r/Globasa/comments/qey694/revised_proposal_syon_si_or_null/) in English and their equivalents in other languages are rendered as follows: two-syllable words end in **-syon**; longer words end in **-si**. However, verbs that ending in _-ate_ in English take neither _-syon_ nor _-si_, and simply end in **-a**. 

### Words Sourced from English

Words sourced primarily from English are rendered in Globasa based on the following rule of thumb: If an English phoneme can be rendered faithfully with Globasa's inventory, pronunciation is favored. Otherwise, the Globasa form favors the English spelling. Caveats: /oʊ/, as in _post_, _note_ and _boat_, is rendered as ⟨o⟩; /ʊ/, as in _foot_, is rendered as ⟨u⟩; /z/ as in _visit_ is rendered as ⟨s⟩. To further illustrate: 

-    Spelling is favored for so-called _short_ vowels as well as for single vowels reduced to /ə/: **Alaska**, **Nevada**, **Misisipi**, **Boston**, **Konetikut**, etc. 

-    Spelling is favored for ⟨er⟩, ⟨ir⟩ and ⟨ur⟩ pronounced as /ɜr/: **hamburger** (hamburger), **hamuster** (hamster), **eskirti** (skirt), etc.  

-    Spelling is favored for ⟨au⟩: **Awgusta** (Augusta)

-    Pronunciation is favored for most vowel clusters: **Finiks** (Phoenix), **Wudrow** (Woodrow), **Tenesi** (Tennessee)

-    Pronunciation is favored for ⟨are⟩: **Delawer** (Delaware)

-    Pronunciation is favored for so-called _long_ vowels, except for _long o_, in which case spelling is favored: **beykon** (bacon), **eskeyti** (skate), **Aydaho** (Idaho), **Yuta** (Utah); _long o_: **Ohayo** (Ohio), etc. 

-    Pronunciation is favored for most consonants, except _s_ when pronounced as /z/, in which case spelling is favored: **Misuri** (Missouri)

### Words Sourced from Mandarin

Words sourced from Mandarin are typically blended with their Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese forms. An attempt is usually made to simplify Mandarin phonotactics when supported by the other East Asian languages, particularly Japanese.

-    Pinyin _-ang_ is often rendered as ⟨o⟩ in Globasa, as seen in Japanese.

-    A consonant plus glide is often reduced to a consonant.

-    Likewise, diphthongs are often reduced to a simple vowel. 

### Words Sourced from Arabic

-    The diphthong /au̯/ is often reduced to ⟨o⟩, as seen in Swahili or Persian: **soti**, etc.  

-    The diphthong /aj/ is sometimes reduced to ⟨e⟩, as seen in Swahili: **rehani**, etc.  

-    Unless there is a different naturalistic option supported by Persian, Swahili, Turkish, Indonesian or Hindi, noun/verb words sourced from Arabic typically end in **-u**, as seen in the present tense of [Arabic verbs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Globasa/comments/py1a17/final_vowels_added_based_recently_established/).
